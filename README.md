# J-app
For STEM Challenge
## Why?
The "original" time table is too boring.
## What?
`/Model` stores `Table.cs` which stores `Period` class.
`/View` stores XAML files that draw UI onto screen.

Files in `/Services` and `/ViewModel` connect "Model" and "View" together. 
## Soonâ„¢
Future plans for J-app are:
- Notification systems
- Customizations
etc.
